## What it does 
We've developed a dynamic website that empowers building managers to make well-informed decisions based on the historical, real-time, and predictive status of their assets. The website boasts a cutting-edge 3D interactive floorplan of the building and it leverages Cartesi's rollup framework to facilitate decentralized AI-powered asset repair scheduling. An email notification system further enhances user experience. This amalgamation of technologies and features equips building managers with a holistic asset management solution, enabling proactive maintenance planning.

## How we built it
Creating the interactive floorplan involved harnessing Python and Plotly for visual representation. Machine learning played a pivotal role in predicting asset service dates by analyzing asset type and historical data. Our website is built on the WordPress platform and hosted on Google Cloud, with MongoDB serving as our data storage solution.

## Challenges we ran into
Our primary challenge revolved around integrating Google Cloud with Pork Bun Web Hosting. The limited documentation available, given the relatively new technology, posed hurdles during the integration process.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We take pride in successfully integrating more than eight different technologies to bring our website to life.

## Inspiration
Our team's primary source of inspiration was to come up with solutions involving a large amount of data.

## What we learned
Our journey involved delving into several unfamiliar technologies, including the Cartesi rollup framework, MongoDB, and Google Cloud.

## What's next for Build Space
In the pipeline for Build Space is the development of a login system for the building managers, integrating sensors for data collection and the ability for the manager to view multiple properties.
